# CSS Introduction

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- **Cascading** refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.
- **Style Sheets** control the look and feel of web documents.
- CSS and HTML work hand in hand:
- HTML sorts out the page structure.
- CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed.

Why Use CSS? 

- CSS allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.
- The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate **style** from **content.**
- Using just HTML, all the styles and formatting are in the same place, which becomes rather difficult to maintain as the page grows.
