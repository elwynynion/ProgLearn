# CSS Marings


The CSS `margin` properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

# Margin - Individual Sides

CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

- `margin-top`
- `margin-right`
- `margin-bottom`
- `margin-left`

All the margin properties can have the following values:

- auto - the browser calculates the margin
- *length* - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
- *%* - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
- inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

**Tip:** Negative values are allowed.

Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:

```css
p {
 margin-top: 100px;
 margin-bottom: 100px;
 margin-right: 150px;
 margin-left: 80px;
}
```
