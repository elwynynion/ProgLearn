The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```

## **Example Explained**

- `p` is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).

- `color` is a property, and `red` is the property value

- `text-align` is a property, and `center` is the property value
