# Text Formatting

In HTML, there is a list of elements that specify text style.

Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

- `<B>` - defines bold text.
- `<BIG>` - defines text with a bigger font size; now considered an obsolete HTML element.
- `<I>` - defines italicized text.
- `<SMALL>` - defines text with a smaller font size; now considered obsolete.
- `<STRONG>` - defines important text; text will look almost the same as bold text.
- `<SUB>` - defines subscripted text.
- `<SUP>` - defines superscripted text.
- `<INS>` - defines inserted text; text will usually be displayed with underline.
- `<DEL>` - defines text that has been deleted from a document; text will usually be displayed with a strikethrough(a horizontal line in the middle of the text).
- `<EM>` - defines emphasized text; text will looks almost the same italicized text.
