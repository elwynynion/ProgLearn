# Elements

- HTML documents are made up of HTML elements.
- An HTML element is written using a start tag an end tag, with the content in between.
- HTML elements can be nested within the HTML document:

```html
<HTML>
  <head>
    <title>first page</title>
  </head>
<body>
  <p>this is a paragraph <br /></p>
</body>
</html>
```

- Some elements do not require a closing tag, such as the single-line break element.
