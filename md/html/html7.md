# Images

**The <IMG> Tag**

- The **<IMG>** tag is used to insert an image using its **location address.**
- It contains only attributes and does not have a closing tag.
- the image’s **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** can be defined using the **SRC** Attribute:

```html
<IMG SRC=”image.jpg”/>
```

**Image Location** 

- The location address for the image is inserted as a value for the **src attribute** between a pair of **quotation marks (” “):**

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>first page</title>
  </head>
<body>
  <img src-”tree.jpg” alt=””>
</body>
</html>
```
