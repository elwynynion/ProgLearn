# JavaScript For Loop

- One of many people looping constructs in JS, which allow the execution of code for a set number of times, which is handy for running code that needs to be run repeatedly.
- Is considered the most commonly used loop.
- Consists primarily of three (3) statements, each divided by a semicolon (;), for its condition block:
    1. The first statement contains any statements executed before the loop starts, such as the declaration of relevant variables(usually counter variables).
    2. The second statement contains the actual condition or expression to be evaluated for the loop.
    3. The third statement contains any statements executed after the loop has been executed, such as incrementing or decrementing of relevant variables.
- The loop’s code block will be executed a number of times based on the condition block’s values.

```jsx
// program to display text 5 times
const n = 5;

// looping from i = 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(`I love JavaScript.`);
}

Output

I love JavaScript.
I love JavaScript.
I love JavaScript.
I love JavaScript.
I love JavaScript.
```
