# JavaScriptÂ While Loop and do-while loop

### While loop

- A loop that repeats a block of code as long as the condition returns a Boolean value of True.
- The condition, however, can also be altered so that the loop repeats when the condition returns a value of False.
- All while loops will return ONLY Boolean values.
- Developers must never forget to increase the counter variable used in the condition so that it will eventually return a false value; forgetting to do so will result in an infinite loop.

```jsx
// program to display numbers from 1 to 5
// initialize the variable
let i = 1, n = 5;

// while loop from i = 1 to 5
while (i <= n) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}

Output

1
2
3
4
5
```

### Do-While Loop

- Considered as a variant of the while loop
- This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

```jsx
// program to display numbers
let i = 1;
const n = 5;

// do...while loop from 1 to 5
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= n);

Output

1
2
3
4
5
```
