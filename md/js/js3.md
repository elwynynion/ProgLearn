# JavaScript External

- Scripts that are written and placed in external files.
- external files have the file extension .js for JavaScript.
- HTML documents can call on these files to execute their script/s using the SRC attribute of the `<SCRIPT>` tag.
- External JS files don’t use the `<SCRIPT>` tag pair of their code; developers can directly write their script code on the file as if it’s a normal text file.

A. Advantages of External Scripting

- Code Separation- It separates HTML and JS code completely by having the script code written in a separate file.
- Code Maintenance- Due to being written in two (2) separate files, allows better readability and maintainability of both HTML and JS code.
- Faster Page Loading- JS files are cached, speeding up loading times for web pages.
