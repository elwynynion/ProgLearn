# JavaScript Variables

**Variables** are containers for storing data values. the value of a variable can change throughout the program.

Declaring a variable is as simple as using the keyword **var**. Which would look like this:

```jsx
var x = 10;
```

In this example, we’ve assigned a value of **10** to the variable **x**.

We’ve used the word assigned deliberately here, because in JavaScript, the equal sign(=) is actually called the “**assignment**” operator, rather than an “equal to” operator.

Which means that in JavaScript, **x = y** will assign the value of **y** to **x** variable.
