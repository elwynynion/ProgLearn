# JavaScriptÂ Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:

```jsx
let length = 16; // Number
let lastName = "Johnson"; // String
let x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; // Object
```

### The Concept of Data Types

In programming, data types is an important concept.

To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

```jsx
let x = 16 + "Volvo";
```

Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result?

JavaScript will treat the example above as:

```jsx
let x = "16" + "Volvo";
```

When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

```jsx
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x = 16 + "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
